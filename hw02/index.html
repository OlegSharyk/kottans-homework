														<h2>About Tesla</h2>
														<p><strong>TESLA MOTORS</strong> was founded in 2003 by a group of Silicon Valley engineers who set out to prove that electric vehicles could be awesome.</p>
														<p><strong>THE TESLA ROADSTER</strong> hit the streets in early 2008 as a sports car that can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and travel for 245 miles per charge.</p>
														<p><strong>MODEL S</strong> arrived in 2012. A premium sedan that goes from 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds and travels for 265 miles per charge, Model S has received numerous accolades, including Car of the Year awards and a 5-star safety rating from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It is the second step in Tesla's "Secret Plan" to accelerate the world's transition to electric mobility.</p>

														<p><strong>MODEL X</strong>, set to enter volume production in 2015, is a crossover utility vehicle that blends the best of an SUV with the benefits of a minivan. As stylish as it is functional, Model X is a vehicle above category.</p>
														<p><strong>SUPERCHARGERS</strong> let Model S and Model X owners charge for free at strategic locations, enabling long distance road trips in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
														<p><strong>TESLA'S BATTERIES AND POWERTRAINS</strong> will help lessen global dependence on petroleum-based transportation and drive down the cost of electric vehicles. By cooperating with other car manufacturers, we hope to put more electric cars on the road.</p>
														<p><strong>EVERY TESLA AND EV</strong> using our technology is a step towards making increasingly affordable electric cars available to the consumer.</p>
														<p>It's more than electric, it's Tesla.</p>

                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <h2>Order Placed</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>I just designed my Model S and submitted my order. What are the next steps?</dt>
                    <dd>There is a two-week window when changes can be made to your order before your Model S design is submitted to the factory. The e-mail address and password used while configuring your Model S will be your login for My Tesla. Here, you can immediately submit your order, or make changes during the two-week window. A Delivery Experience Specialist will be in touch shortly after your order is confirmed to guide you through payment, document signing and delivery logistics.</dd>
                    <dt>When will my car begin production?</dt>
                    <dd>After your order is confirmed and submitted to the factory, we will begin scheduling production for your custom Model S. The most current production timing can be found in the Design Studio for each battery type. Before your order is confirmed, this is your best resource for delivery timing. Tesla will always assume that you prefer the fastest delivery possible, unless you specify differently (discussed in the question below.) Once your order is confirmed we will keep you up to date in My Tesla and your Delivery Experience Specialist will be happy to provide updates as well.</dd>
                    <dt>How do I make sure I get my Model S when I want it?</dt>
                    <dd>Upon ordering your Model S, you will be asked to submit your delivery preference. This will automatically assume you would like the fastest delivery timeline available. If you would like to delay the production of your car, please ensure your delivery preference is accurately marked in My Tesla before you confirm your order. We will do our best to accommodate a timely delivery. If you need to change your delivery timing after order confirmation, please discuss with your Delivery Experience Specialist as soon as possible.</dd>
                    <dt>I've configured my car, but I don't want to wait two weeks before my order is submitted to the factory. Can I waive this waiting period?</dt>
                    <dd>Yes. If you're happy with your configuration, we can expedite your order submission to the factory once you've submitted your order payment. Please call us at (888) 771-2505 and select option 1. Keep in mind that changes can only be made during the initial two-week window before your order is placed. You may also confirm your order before the two weeks are up by clicking "Confirm Order" in your My Tesla account.</dd>
                    <dt>Can I change my order after the two week waiting period?</dt>
                    <dd>Once your order has been submitted to the factory, changes typically cannot be made because we immediately begin sourcing parts for your custom Model S. Please call us at (888) 771-2505 and select option 1 if you would like to consult on this matter with a member of our sales team.</dd>
                    <dt>When will I receive my Model S VIN?</dt>
                    <dd>Approximately 5-6 weeks before planned production, a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is assigned to your Model S and will appear in My Tesla. A VIN is often required for insurance and financing applications.</dd>

                <h2>Financing</h2>   
                <dl>
									<dt>How do I apply for Tesla Financing?</dt>
									<dt>Tesla offers an exciting and innovative new financing program for Model S that combines the benefits of both leasing and ownership. You can read more about this option on our Financing page. Tesla Financing is currently available in CA, CO, FL, GA, IL, MA, MN, MO, NC, NV, NY, OH, OR and WA, and you can apply online in My Tesla. After submitting the application, the Tesla Financing team will contact you within 48 hours. If you have questions, you may contact them directly at <a href="mailto:&#097;&#117;&#116;&#111;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#097;&#110;&#099;&#101;&#064;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#108;&#097;&#109;&#111;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#097;&#117;&#116;&#111;&#102;&#105;&#110;&#097;&#110;&#099;&#101;&#064;&#116;&#101;&#115;&#108;&#097;&#109;&#111;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a></dt>
									<dt>Can I finance with my own bank or credit union?</dt>
									<dd>Yes. To finance with a 3rd party bank or credit union, you must provide your VIN, which will be found in your My Tesla account once it has been assigned. In order to apply 3rd party financing to your Model S purchase, Tesla requires the name of the funding institution, the exact dollar amount of your loan, and the lien-holder address and phone number.</dd>
